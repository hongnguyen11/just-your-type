Rationale
I choose this theme because I really love this show. It has good plot twists.
I wanted to find a typeface that is similar to its title typeface but I couldn't so I chose 2 typefaces that have the same feeling with its title and works well with each other.
I used black and red because they can remind viewers of the show
